Sheffield MyPC Autobooker is a program which will enable automatic booking of computers
within the information commons, normally through the system available at
https://mypc.shef.ac.uk/MyPC3/

This is performed by automating the process, for periods over the normal 4 hours lockout
and it will do automatic logon at midnight to book just opened booking slots immediately.
