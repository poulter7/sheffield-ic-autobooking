Sheffield MyPC Autobooker is a program which will enable automatic booking of computers
within the information commons, normally through the system available at
https://mypc.shef.ac.uk/MyPC3/

The system is insecure and this application is able to demonstrate so by automating booking, performing block bookings for limited resources for easily a whole day.
This is performed by automating the process, for periods over the normal 4 hours lockout and it will do automatic logon at midnight to book just opened booking slots immediately.
This could easily be rewritten as a webservice and there would be possibilities of effectively selling Information Commons resources.
I clearly don't encourage use of this kind.

Booking requests are simple gets of this form:
Make booking 5:00 - 6:00

Delete a booking:
Booking ID increases past number given here as a counter.
https://mypc.shef.ac.uk/MyPC3/Front.aspx?page=booking&startTime=05%3A00&endTime=06%3A00&resourceId=286&date=09%2F06%2F2010&command=delete&bookingId=731462

This would allow us to eventually replicate all functionality of the booking system if so desired.
Cannot delete bookings of other users. Such that I have found.
