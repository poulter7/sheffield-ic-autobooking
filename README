Sheffield MyPC Autobooker is a program which will enable automatic booking of computers
within the information commons, normally through the system available at
https://mypc.shef.ac.uk/MyPC3/

This is performed by automating the process, for periods over the normal 4 hours lockout
and it will do automatic logon at midnight to book just opened booking slots immediately.

Booking requests are simple gets of this form:
Make booking 5:00 - 6:00

Delete a booking:
Booking ID increases past number given here as a counter.

This would allow us to eventually replicate all functionality of the booking system if so desired.
Cannot delete bookings of other users. Such that I have found.
